# Coding QuizIn

## Description

The powers of HTML, CSS and Javascript and use of bootstrap easily customize interfaces. Web APIs or Application Programming Interface are used to control software using documented receivers. Through application of HTML DOM API and local storage interface use, the front end side of designing is almost complete with this process. Web API helps in enabling the development of HTTP services to reach out to client entities like browser, devices or tablets. By utilizing jQuery, developers are able to write more and do less and in this challenge the coding process was much more simplified with the new tools available. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

## Installation


The HTML file was started from scratch for this assignment which means that HTML, JavaScript and CSS files were not provided and as the developer I had to create my own document structure for this assignment. The install included creating a container header with jQuery tags. Next I created a veiw scores button for the high scores as well a timer of 75 seconds with 10 seconds taken off each wrong question answered. Then was a Container for Introduction, Questions and Answers with a welcome screen stating "Welcome to the Javascript Coding quiz Challenge" to make sure the user is ready before the timer starts  as well as a description of rules. The user then answers questions and at the end is given a score based on the amount of time used and correct answers and is asked to submit their initals for a high score. 



## Usage

Screenshots including HTML file with a bootstrap, use of the copy right reference and jQuery information, and Javascript screenshots showing the answer checker as well as a conditional statement for the if statement.
